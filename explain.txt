About over-segmentation:

	1. Object with a low contrast (color is close to white) will have relative bad segmentation. Some of the edges are not detected by the algorithm.

	2. The white areas on objects tend to be classified into background.

	3. Most high contrast object have good segmentation.

About changing tau:

	1. When tau is in range [0.2-0.7], the foreground and background segmentation have a good performances.

	2. When tau is lower than 0.2, the segmentation will classify some other superpixels whose color is close to the foreground object as foreground.

	3. When tau is higher than 0.7, few superpixel is classified as foreground so the whole image is black.

About changing key:

 	1. If the key is changed within a same object, the object will be extracted.

	2. If the key is changed into another object, that object will be extracted.

I think it is useless for Spot-It game. Because we can't determine which object to be extracted. If we know, we don't need to segment it.
